# 📅 PaperPlanner

**Simple, printable planner templates for mindful productivity.**
Created to support creatives, coaches, faith leaders, spiritual entrepreneurs, and anyone seeking structure without screens.

## ✨ Why These Planners?

Most digital planners are overly complex. Many printed planners are expensive or rigid. These templates were created to offer a **clean, customizable, and low-tech solution**—optimized for handwriting and mental clarity.

* 🖊️ Designed for printing and writing by hand
* 🗓️ Based on a 6-day week structure with a **movable Sabbath rest day**
* 🔒 **Resistant to “digital cheating.”** No drag‑and‑drop rescheduling, no silent deletions—writing it down makes commitments tangible and harder to ignore.
* 🧠 Built for **intentional scheduling** that works with your subconscious mind
* 📥 Available in `.docx` format for easy customization.
* 📥 Available in `.pdf` format to ensure proper formatting when printing.

## 📂 What’s Included

* **Refined Weekly Planner**
  A 3‑day‑per‑page spread with time blocks from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and space to write in your days. Includes a Sabbath rest note and a weekly reflection page.
* *Monthly At-a-Glance*

  A customizable month-at-a-glance landscape calendar will be added later this week (it's on my calendar).

## 🔄 How to Use

1. Download and print the `.docx` or `.pdf` file.
2. Write in your week range and days of the week by hand.
3. Fill in your schedule, goals, and intentions for the week.
4. Keep it visible—on your desk, in a binder, or on the wall.

This practice isn’t just about staying organized. It’s about training the subconscious through repeated, written intention.
